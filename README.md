### Mallard is a self-hosted, no-nonsense, straight-forward RSS reader.

It's a sinatra application can run on a VPS or Heroku.

## Requirements

The app is configured to run on Ruby 2.2, however it should work fine on Ruby 2.0 and 2.1. Just modify the Gemfile. The `bundler` gem is also required.

You will also need PostgreSQL to store the feed and entry information.

## Installing/Updating/Configuring

Check out the repo and navigate to the root of the app. Install the required gems using `bundle`.

Copy `config/database.example.yml` to `config/database.yml` and upate the configuration to fit your needs.

Create the database by running `bundle exec rake db:create`

Create/update the table structure wtih `rake db:migrate`

You can start the app by running `unicorn -c config/unicorn.rb`

The default port unicorn runs on is 8080.

When you visit the app for the first time in your browser (http://localhost:8080), you will be prompted to create a password. Once that is entered, you'll be able to login.

Once logged in, go to "Manage Feeds" and then click the "Add" button to start adding your feeds.

## Fetching Entries

The manage feeds page has a manual fetch button for each feed you have configured.

You can also fetch new entries for all feeds by running `rake fetch`

## App Concole

Running `rake console` will drop you in an irb session within the app - allowing you to view and manipulate the models.

## Tests

Tests are written in MiniTest and can be ran with `rake test`.
